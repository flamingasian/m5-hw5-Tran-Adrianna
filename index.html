        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> Having been born and raised in Florida, my interest in public service stems from my passion to help
            others and my strong desire to give back to the community that I love and have been a part of my entire life.
            From my early start in volunteering, to my several internships with state legislators and state agencies, and now
            in my position as an aide in the Florida Legislature, I have gained the real experience needed in order to succeed
            in any position I hold. </p>

        <p> Since starting my position as a district aide to State Representative Kamia Brown in March 2021, I have
            been the acting legislative aide for two Regular Sessions and four Special Sessions. In my time, I have been
            able to sharpen and hone various skills, including writing and editing various texts, communications, graphic
            design, and being able to adapt in any situation.</p>
